Library management system with API written on C++/drogon and Client written on C++/wxWidgets. 
This is my course work for the second semester.

Production runs on the following domain: [lib.kmarkin.com](http://lib.kmarkin.com/).
It will be alive at least till 10th of June 2022.

Docker image building and production deploy are automated via GitHub Actions.
The only thing you need to do is to push new commits to **prod** branch.

You can find all API requests 
[here in Postman public workspace](https://www.postman.com/kmarkindev/workspace/bsuir-cw-library)
